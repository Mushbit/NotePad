 # Aditional Note
 
 I would like to add a few lines on the yellow part of the notepad on launch to fill the empty space currently there.
 When starting to add items, the lines will turn from gray to how they apear currently, when adding an item.
 This would be a great addition from a design perspective.
 
 The code, and then particulary the CSS part, is a little messy. I could clean it up but I prefer to move on to the next project and do better
 This project was written before figuring out the beauty of 'rem' values and understanding flex.
 That all being said, I love how it turned out and hope you do too :)
